blueprint
=========

### Motivation

	NodeJS is awesome. However; there are not a lot of good resources to get you rolling FAST.
  	So I wanted to write a lightweight blueprint for a startup. There are certain requirements 
  	that all startups / web based apps have, I'm trying to address/automate them.

### Inspirations: Monk (ruby), Sinatra, Rails, Express/Connect

### Setup & Usage

```bash
$ sudo npm install blueprint -g
$ blueprint init yourappname
```

### blueprint CLI (blueprint [my_command])

	Commands:
   		help             		Display usage information
      	init					Initialize a blueprint app
      	generate [mvc-item]		Generate a scaffold
      	routes 					Display alls application routes
