blueprint
=========

### HUGE NOTE
 
  This module is stable and production ready in 0.0.9. This is the latest
  module available via npm. Until then, only clone/fork the project if you are
  interested in developing on it, as it will not be stable. :P
  
### Setup & Usage

```bash
$ [sudo] npm install -g blueprint
$ blueprint yournewapp
$ cd yournewapp
$ npm install
$ node app.js
```
