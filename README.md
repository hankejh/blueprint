# blueprint

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/edwardhotchkiss/blueprint.png)](http://travis-ci.org/edwardhotchkiss/blueprint)

## Motivation

	NodeJS is awesome. However; there are not a lot of good resources to get you rolling FAST.
  	So I wanted to write a lightweight blueprint for a startup. There are certain requirements 
  	that all startups / web based apps have, I'm trying to address/automate them.

## Inspirations: Monk (ruby), Sinatra, Rails, Express/Connect

## Setup & Usage

```bash
$ sudo npm install blueprint -g
$ blueprint init yourappname
```

## blueprint CLI (blueprint [my_command])

	Commands:
   		help             			Display usage information
      	init						Initialize a blueprint app
      	generate [mvc-item]			Generate a scaffold
      	routes 						Display alls application routes
